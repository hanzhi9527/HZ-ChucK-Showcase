This is a showcase project I completed in Spring 2018 at the University of Rochester. 
It’s done by a music interactive programming language called “ChucK.” For the project I plotted a space trip by Mario and Luigi, encrypted the code and triggered the sounds in the screen with my laptop keyboard and a Logitech car joystick.
